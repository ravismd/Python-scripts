# Python-scripts
testing python scripting techniques

Prerquisits before running the script.
1. we need to configure the IAM credentials to get connected to S3
$aws configure (provide access key and secret key and region name(ap-south-1)
 
also have provided the command to created the folder /opt/docker but first script will fail sicne we do not have the folder yet.

also there is bug in script while removing containers when the container is in stopped state, need to fix it..
